## To Bet or Not to Bet: Analyzing the Credibility of Fixed-odds Betting on Match Outcomes by Tseegi Nyamdorj, Fungai Jani, Maria Tsakalakos

This project aims to build a comprehensive predictive framework for forecasting match results in the Premier League season of 2018-2019. To build upon the already existing foundation of **betting odds** we enriched our predictive models by adding two key components: **player evaluation metrics** and **the recent form of the teams** based on their performances over the last five matches. The addition of player evaluation metrics is to give a better gauge of the strength of each team and where the strength lies in comparison to its opposition. We aim to contribute significant insights that can help sports analysts, coaches, and enthusiast alike in making more informed decisions and understanding the dynamics of competitive football matches in one of the most esteemed leagues in the world. This was done through a thorough evaluation of three different models: **Generalized Additive Models**, **Random Forest** and **Multinomial Models**.
